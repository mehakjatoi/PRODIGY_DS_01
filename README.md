**Data Visualization and Analysis of Global Population Trends**

As part of my Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech, I completed a task focusing on data visualization and analysis of global population trends using Python.

This project involved using Matplotlib and Pandas to analyze and visualize population data obtained from the World Bank dataset. The goal was to gain insights into global demographic changes over the last 60+ years through various graphical representations.

**Key Tasks**

**Data Collection:** Acquired population data from the World Bank dataset spanning from 1960 to the present.

**Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Processed the dataset to handle missing values and format data for analysis.

**Data Visualization:** Utilized Matplotlib to create a variety of visualizations including histograms and bar charts. These visualizations were aimed at understanding population distributions and trends across different regions and countries.

**Technologies Used**:

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib
